  - The writing style has been simplified and I'm finding it much
    easier to read. Nice work!
  - Amazing amount of content and very cool subject
  - TODO Warnings are mixed up with Dart Warnings about missing `const`.
    Suggestion: Provide `const` in the correct places to solve the problem so
    the user can focus on the task at hand, or ignore `const` issues with `//
    ignore_for_file: prefer_const_constructors,
    prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables`
      - Odd, after coding up the solution without adding `const` anywhere, the
        warnings somehow go away. I wonder if something weird is happening with
        DartPad?
  - Early Steps are much more interactive now! That's great :)
  - Could step 2 be split up into 2 or 3 steps? Not sure, but it took me a
    ~10-15 minutes to get through that step.
  - Step 5 starts with an app that has 700 lines of code. That's a lot of code
    to read and understand if you're haven't written it yourself, and it's kind of
    hard to know what you're modifying without taking time to go through that
    code. In steps 5-8 I'm following along, but getting lost in all of the code
    a bit. Perhaps I should have taken more time to really read through and
    understand it, but that would also take 10-15 minutes alone, taking my
    attention away from the topic at hand. Not sure how to solve this
    challenge!
  - By step 7, I'm getting a bit "tired."
  - Final impressions: the final app is so cool, but I do wonder if there's
    simpler ways to teach some of the concepts, where the user can write more of
    the code? 
      - Example: Step 6, could you introduce the concept with the sweet looking
        app, but then the exercise is just positioning two big colorful boxes
        depending on the amount of space? That way the entire app could be a
        total of 50-100 lines of code, mostly written by the workshop taker.
      - Alternatively, is there a way to introduce or walk users through the app
        in step 5? It just feels a bit hard to "catch up" with what's going on
        without taking some real time to understand that code. Understanding a 700
        line app takes a reasonable amount of time, even for an experienced
        Flutter dev.
  - Total time to take the workshop: 1hr 47mins
  - Step 9: `snippet.dart` shows "Not Found" in the window. Should probably just
    be the same content as `solution.dart` in step 8 to prevent the issue?
  - Please note: This is my personal impression! If you disagree with the
    feedback, and you want folks to take the time to understand the code and
    modify it, please just take that time into consideration and walk folks
    through the app you've written a bit more in step 5.
